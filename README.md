## Post-diagnosis Diabetes Care 
The burden of diabetes is rapidly increasing. Access to a primary care physician, obtaining a diabetic eye exam and getting an A1c level test are considered health care utilization quality measures and are considered essential services to ensure adequate management of diabetes and prevention of diabetes complications. 

We are interested in exploring the healthcare journey of patients diagnosed with diabetes. Specifically, we want to learn if we can predict patterns of patients' likelihood to utilize their healthcare services based on where they live.

We're specifically interested in analyzing three key healthcare services to measure healthcare utilization based on geographic location: 
1) Going to their primary care physician (PCP)
2) Getting a diabetic eye exam (retinopathy)
3) Getting an A1c test, which identifies prediabetes
 
### Reason for choosing this topic
One of our team members is an ophthalmologist who has a special interest in diabetic retinopathy, an eye exam that serves as both early detection and a treatment option for diabetics. She shared her interest in exploring criteria that may affect a diabetic patient's likelihood to follow through with their healthcare protocol, because if our model can help predict those at risk of poor health care utilization, there's an opportunity to consider additional incentives focused on that group in her line of work. With three out of five team members in health care, this was a natural fit, and we liked the idea of analyzing data that had the potential to make an impact.

### Description source of data 
Our dataset came from [Dartmouth Atlas Data](https://data.dartmouthatlas.org/primary-care/), a direct recommendation from someone in the medical community.

"The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care: For more than 20 years, the Dartmouth Atlas Project has documented glaring variations in how medical resources are distributed and used in the United States. The project uses Medicare and Medicaid data to provide information and analysis about national, regional, and local markets, as well as hospitals and their affiliated physicians."

### What it is exactly that we want to know

The main question we are aiming to answer is: What is the likelihood of patients with diabetes adhering to the health care utilization metrics (1-3 above) given a specific geographic location?

We also plan to explore the following:
1) Evaluating trends in health care utilization metrics (1-3 above) across years 
2) Evaluate any racial differences in health care utilization metrics (1-3 above) 

## Team Communication Protocol

### Written communication
• Primary communication: Slack

• Email and Google Drive for file sharing

### Weekly meetings
• Tuesdays and Thursdays during class time

• Fridays 5-6

• Optional working sessions

  • Saturday 12-2

  • Sunday 12-2


Two people are assigned to every task so there’s always a backup if needed

### Centralized Workstations 
GitHub for branch commits and Google Drive for project management/organization
